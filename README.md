## Getting Started

Template-UI is built with React and TypeScript (TSX). This guide will help you set up the project locally and start experimenting with UI/UX design concepts.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pou-1/Template_UI.git
  ```
Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd template-ui
  ```

Install the dependencies:

Using npm:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

Start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This will start the app and you can view it in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

## Usage

Template-UI is designed to test and showcase different UI/UX elements. Feel free to modify existing components or add new ones to experiment with layouts, color schemes, typography, and interactive elements.
Running the Project

Once the project is running locally, you can view the design in your browser and make live edits to the components. The development server will hot-reload the changes automatically.

Open src/App.tsx to modify the main layout.
Add UI components in src/components/ and use them in your design.
Modify styling through src/styles/ for CSS or SCSS.
